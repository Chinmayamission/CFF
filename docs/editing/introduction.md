# Editing a form

All forms can be configured using JSON configuration options. You can edit three things in a form:

- **schema** - data structure of the form. This is rendered using JSON Schema.

- **uiSchema** - look and feel of the form. This is where you can configure CSS class names or custom widgets to be rendered on the form.

- **formOptions** - configures other options such as payment integration, responses view, form submission closing, confirmation emails, and more.
