You can use our S3 bucket to upload images. This is useful if you need to upload images that go in a confirmation email or something, but do not want to upload the images to another image service.

- Log in to the gcmw-media bucket.
- Go to the cff.chinmayamission.com folder.
- Upload the image here.
- The image url is of the format: `http://d1dyr7ljeznkdv.cloudfront.net/cff.chinmayamission.com/{image name}`.
- For example, http://d1dyr7ljeznkdv.cloudfront.net/cff.chinmayamission.com/OmRunWide-2019.png.
