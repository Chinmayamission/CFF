OmitExtraData can be used. This is important when there are complex forms with dependencies, and you do not want extra data to be used there. See https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#form-submission for more details.

Just set `formOptions.omitExtraData` to be true and then this will be enabled.
