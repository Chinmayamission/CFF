1. Create a new pull request from the GitHub repository to the master branch. Choose two branches to see what's changed or to start a new pull request.

1. Add screenshots/details of the changes to the new pull request and send it for approval.
1. Once another developer approves the request, you can merge the pull request to Master so the changes will show up in Master

1. Remember to delete the branch in Github once the changes are merged to master.
1. The final step is make sure you go back to the master branch in the VS Code project and sync it so that the changes show up on your local version of master.
