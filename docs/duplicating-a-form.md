If you already have a form that you used last year and need to use the same (or a similar) version of the form for this year, duplicating a form is useful.

**Use cases**
- CMA Walkathon uses CFF for 2017 registration. Now, they want to make a 2018 registration.
- CMNY uses CFF for the 2017 retreat. Now, they want to make the same form for 2018.

**Steps**
1. Go and sign in to https://forms.chinmayamission.com/admin/
1. Right click the form from last year and click "Duplicate".

1. A copy of the form will be on the bottom. Right click that form and click "Edit".

1. Make additional changes to the formOptions, schema, uiSchema as needed to reflect the new wording or new pricing for the new year. You can go to the "Share" tab and share this new form with whoever you need to; duplicating a form does not share it with the people the old form was shared with.
1. Click on "View" to get the link for the new form that you can now share and embed on your own site.
